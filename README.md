# Repository for  AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products

# IBM Python Final Project Scenario
You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

# Step 1: Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git

Folder structure

# Step 2: Create an emotion detection application using the Watson NLP library
 
 Create a file named emotion_detection.py in the main repo

Test your application in the python shell

# Step 3: Format the output of the application

# Step 4: Package the application

Test your application in the python shell

![4b_packaging_test](https://github.com/ForkahEH/IBM-Developing-AI-Applications-with-Python-and-Flask/assets/127892742/272f2708-14c2-4833-a80a-9bae9b0bc11a)

# Step 5: Run unit tests on your application

 Create a new file, test_emotion_detection.py that calls the required application function from the package and tests it for given statements and dominant emotions.

Execute the test_emotion_detection.py file on terminal

# Step 6: Web deployment of the application using Flask

Create the server.py file

![6a_server](https://github.com/ForkahEH/IBM-Developing-AI-Applications-with-Python-and-Flask/assets/127892742/0d6f803f-eef6-44c0-9bc4-27678d2c8424)

Deploy the application and test it.

# Step 7: Incorporate Error handling

![7a_error_handling_function](https://github.com/ForkahEH/IBM-Developing-AI-Applications-with-Python-and-Flask/assets/127892742/ed00d293-9a1c-4110-bee4-fbcbdf30b1c6)

Modify server.py to incorporate error handling when the dominant_emotion is None.

Deploy the application and test it for blank entries

# Step 8: Run static code analysis

Run static code analysis on the code
